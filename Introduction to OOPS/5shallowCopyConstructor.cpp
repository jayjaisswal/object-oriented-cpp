    obj2.show();

    obj2.show(); // both print the same because both point to same array
}



// The pointer (arr) of the new object points to the same address as the original.

// So, both objects share the same arr in memory.

// That means the new object doesnâ€™t have its own separate copy of the values.

// this is the problem with shallow copy constructor when we have pointer in our class
