// Generalization

// It follows the bottom-up approach.

// Because we combine similar subclasses to form a common superclass.

// Example: Car, Bike â†’ generalized into Vehicle.

// ðŸ§  Hint: Bottom-up â†’ moving upward to general (parent) class.

// Specialization

// It follows the top-down approach.

// Because we start with a superclass and create more specific subclasses.

// Example: Vehicle â†’ specialized into Car, Bike.

// ðŸ§  Hint: Top-down â†’ moving downward to specialized (child) classes.
